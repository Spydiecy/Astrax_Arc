# Astrax

### Talk to Solana in plain English.

An AI agent that turns a chat message into a real on-chain action: payments, tokens,
NFTs, recurring transfers and self-tracking payment links. You stay in control of
every signature.

## 💡 The problem

Using Solana today means juggling a wallet, an explorer, a token tool, a spreadsheet of
addresses and a calendar reminder for every recurring payment. Every one of those steps
is a place where newcomers give up, or paste the wrong address.

## ✨ The solution

Astrax puts all of it behind one chat box. You say what you want, the agent works out
the steps, calls typed Solana tools, and hands you a transaction to approve, or signs
it for you in hands-free devnet mode.

```text
"What's my SOL balance?"
"Send 0.5 SOL to alice"
"Create a token called MoonCoin, symbol MOON, supply 1,000,000"
"Pay the design team 2 SOL every week, 4 times"
"Make a payment link for 0.5 SOL for logo design"
"Is this token safe? <mint address>"
"Show me the SOL price chart for the last 14 days"
```

## 🚀 Features

| | Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 💸 | **Chat to transact** | Send SOL or any SPL / Token-2022 token, to an address or a saved contact name. |
| 🪙 | **Create tokens and NFTs** | Token-2022 mints with on-chain name and symbol, and 1-of-1 NFTs with IPFS metadata. |
| 🗓️ | **Scheduled payments** | One-off or recurring transfers that go out on their own, even after you close the tab. |
| 🔗 | **Self-tracking payment links** | Share a link or Solana Pay QR. Astrax finds the payment on-chain and marks it paid. |
| 🛡️ | **Explain anything** | Paste a transaction, wallet, token or program and get a plain-English breakdown with risk flags. |
| 📈 | **Live market data** | Prices and interactive candlestick charts, rendered right in the chat. |
| 📇 | **Contacts** | A private address book per wallet, so "pay alice" always means *your* alice. |
| 🔐 | **Two signing modes** | Approve each transaction in Phantom, Solflare or Backpack, or go autonomous with a devnet key. |
| 🧠 | **Transparent agent** | Every reply shows the steps and tools it used. Edit, copy or regenerate any message. |
| 🕶️ | **Private chats** | Conversations live only in your browser. Nothing about them is kept on the server. |

Full details for each feature are in [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture

One Next.js app: the UI, the agent and the APIs ship together and deploy to Vercel's
free tier with a free Turso database.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Client["🖥️ Browser"]
        UI["Chat UI<br/>(React 19 + useChat)"]
        W["Wallet<br/>(Wallet Standard)"]
        LS[("Chat history<br/>localStorage")]
        HB["Scheduler heartbeat<br/>(every 60 s)"]
    end

    subgraph Server["⚙️ Next.js on Vercel"]
        AG["/api/agent<br/>streamText + typed tools"]

        RUN["Scheduler runner<br/>/api/scheduler/tick · /api/cron/execute"]
        PAY["/pay/:id<br/>public pay page"]
    end

    subgraph External["🌐 Services"]

        MKT["Coinbase / CoinGecko"]
        IPFS["Pinata IPFS"]
        DB[("Turso / libSQL")]
        CRON["Vercel Cron<br/>(hourly)"]
    end

    UI -- "prompt" --> AG
    AG -- "reasoning" --> LLM

    RUN -- "send due payments" --> RPC

    PAY -- "verify payment" --> RPC

```

### How a chat message becomes a transaction

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as You
    participant C as Chat UI
    participant A as /api/agent
    participant M as Mistral
    participant S as Solana
    participant W as Your wallet

    U->>C: "Send 0.5 SOL to alice"
    C->>A: message + signing mode
    A->>M: prompt + tool definitions
    M-->>A: call resolveContact("alice")
    A-->>M: alice → 7xKX…9fQ
    M-->>A: call sendPayment(0.5 SOL)
    alt Wallet mode
        A->>S: build transaction
        A-->>C: reply + unsigned tx
        C->>W: "Confirm" button
        W->>S: sign and send
    else Autonomous mode
        A->>S: sign server-side and send
    end
    S-->>C: signature + explorer link
    C-->>U: streamed reply with result card
```

### Scheduled payments, with no extra services

Vercel's free plan only allows daily crons, so Astrax combines three triggers. Each one
goes through the same runner, which claims every job atomically in the database before
sending, so a payment can never go out twice.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T1["🖥️ Any open Astrax tab<br/>pings every minute"] --> R
    T2["💬 Chat and schedule requests<br/>check after responding"] --> R
    T3["⏰ 24 Vercel crons<br/>one per hour, CRON_SECRET"] --> R
    R{"Runner<br/>throttled to once per 30 s"} --> Q[("Due jobs<br/>in Turso")]
    Q --> L{"Atomic claim<br/>(lease lock)"}
    L -- "claimed" --> D["Decrypt key<br/>AES-256-GCM"]
    L -- "already taken" --> X["Skip"]
    D --> S["Send on Solana"]
    S -- "more runs left" --> N["Reschedule next run"]
    S -- "finished" --> Z["Mark done, wipe key"]
    S -- "error or interrupted" --> F["Mark failed, wipe key<br/>(never auto-retried)"]
```

**Result:** payments go out within about a minute while anyone has the app open, and
within the hour otherwise.

### Payment links that track themselves

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Creator: 'payment link<br/>for 0.5 SOL'"] --> B["Link saved with a<br/>random reference key"]
    B --> C["Shared as /pay/:id<br/>+ Solana Pay QR"]
    C --> D["Payer pays from<br/>any wallet"]
    D --> E["Server finds the tx<br/>by reference key"]
    E --> F{"Recipient got at least<br/>the amount? Confirmed?<br/>Payer ≠ creator?"}
    F -- "yes" --> G["✅ Marked paid<br/>with signature + payer"]
    F -- "no" --> C
```

## 🔒 Security model

- **You choose who signs.** In wallet mode every transaction is approved in your own
  wallet, and new token mint keys are generated in the browser so they never leave it.
  Autonomous mode is meant for devnet.
- **Keys are never stored in plain text.** A key used for scheduled payments is
  encrypted with AES-256-GCM and wiped as soon as the schedule ends or is cancelled.
  Keys are sent in the request body, never in the prompt, and never logged.
- **Your data is yours.** Contacts, payment links and schedules are only shown after you
  prove you own the wallet with a free signed message. Messages are single-use, expire
  in 5 minutes and are bound to the site's domain. Sessions are HttpOnly cookies.
- **No double payments.** Confirmed transactions are remembered across reloads, scheduled
  jobs are claimed atomically, and an interrupted send is never retried.
- **Hardened endpoints.** Uploads are rate-limited, size-capped and type-checked. The cron
  endpoint uses a constant-time secret check. Model output is rendered without raw HTML.

## ⚡ Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spydiecy/Astrax_colosseum.git
cd Astrax_colosseum
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # add a MISTRAL_API_KEY at minimum
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000, launch the assistant, and either connect a wallet or paste
a devnet secret key in the sidebar **Signing** panel. Grab free devnet SOL from
[faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com).

Locally the database is a file created automatically. Every variable is documented in
[`.env.example`](.env.example).

<details>
<summary><b>Deploying to Vercel</b></summary>

<br />

1. Create a free [Turso](https://turso.tech) database and copy its URL and token.
2. Import the repo into Vercel and add the variables from `.env.example`. Generate
   `AUTH_SECRET`, `SCHEDULER_ENC_KEY` and `CRON_SECRET` with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
3. Deploy. Tables are created on the first request, and the hourly crons in
   `vercel.json` are picked up automatically.

</details>

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Token swaps through a Solana DEX aggregator
- Mainnet support with wallet-only signing
- Payment link webhooks and email receipts
- Multi-recipient and split payments
- Address-book sharing between team wallets
